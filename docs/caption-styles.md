# Caption Styles — implemented + research backlog

Living doc for Instacap's caption styles: what's shipped, what's researched but
not built, and the exact steps to add a new one. Caption styles are real
Remotion compositions (not config-driven presets) — that's the product's
differentiator, keep it that way.

Last updated: 2026-09-01.

## Market context (why this matters)

- **85% of social video is watched muted** — captions are a must-have, and the
  *style* measurably affects watch time.
- **Top-converting mechanics are already shipped** (word-by-word, Hormozi,
  karaoke, box-highlight, single-word). Everything in the backlog below is
  long-tail variety + niche audiences (meme, news, aesthetic/lifestyle), not
  conversion-critical. Prioritize accordingly.
- Best-performing baseline per research: word-by-word / short-phrase, high
  contrast (white+black outline or yellow+black outline), lower-middle third.

## Backlog — researched, not built

Ranked within each tier by impact ÷ effort. "Echoes" = which tool/creator uses it.

### Flagship (needs a product decision)

- **Emoji Pop** — keyword gets an emoji above/beside it. Echoes Submagic's whole
  "Emoji" category; the single biggest engagement driver in short-form and the
  strongest differentiator gap.
  - **Blocked on:** (1) emoji source — curated keyword→emoji map (no dep, ships
    now) vs. LLM/Deepgram tagging pass (best quality, needs a call) vs. manual in
    the editor. (2) **Noto Color Emoji must be installed on the render VM** or
    headless Chromium renders tofu boxes (known Remotion gotcha).

### ~~Recommended 6-pack~~ — SHIPPED 2026-07-22

Gradient, Highlighter, Underline, Glide, Outline, Meme are now implemented (see
the table above). The subsequent visual packs took the set to 27 styles.

### News Bar headline flow

Users can type a category and headline directly in the editor. The optional
"Suggest with AI" button sends the completed transcript to Groq from a
server-side route, returns a factual JSON suggestion, and is rate-limited to
three requests per job. The user can always edit or replace the suggestion.

### Considered and skipped

- **Audio-reactive text** (waveform-driven) — needs an audio-analysis pipeline we
  don't have; revisit only if a music/podcast use case is prioritized.
- **Break-apart / shatter** — high effort (per-letter physics), low payoff.
- **Netflix/classic subtitle** — effectively covered by Minimal + Caption Bar.

## How to add a style (validated checklist)

Every touchpoint a new style must hit. Adding to `STYLES` auto-updates the Zod
validator (`compositionIdSchema` derives from `COMPOSITION_IDS`), but the two
hardcoded unions and the `Record<CompositionId, …>` maps must be edited by hand —
`tsc --noEmit` will catch any you miss.

1. **`remotion/compositions/<Name>.tsx`** — the composition. Props: `transcript,
   videoSrc, activeColor?, textColor?, fontFamily?, fontSizeMultiplier?, posX?,
   posY?`. Render `<OffthreadVideo>` (guarded by `videoSrc`) + a caption
   `<AbsoluteFill>` whose style spreads
   `captionAnchorStyle(paddingBottom, posX, posY)` (from `remotion/lib/caption-layout.ts`)
   so caption-position control works for free. Copy `WordByWord.tsx` as the base.
2. **`remotion/compositions/CaptionRoot.tsx`** — import it, add the id to the
   `CompositionId` union, add a dispatch branch (passes `{...shared}` which
   already carries colors/font/size/posX/posY).
3. **`remotion/Root.tsx`** — import + a `<Composition>` entry (Remotion Studio only;
   the app renders via the `CaptionRoot` dispatcher, so this is for dev preview).
4. **`src/types/job.types.ts`** — add the id to `RenderJobPayload.compositionId`
   (duplicate hardcoded union — must stay in sync with `CompositionId`).
5. **`src/helpers/style-options.ts`** — add a `STYLES` entry `{ id, label, desc,
   category }`. New categories go in `CATEGORY_ORDER`.
6. **`components/preview-player.tsx`** — add an `INITIAL_SETTINGS[<id>]` entry
   (`SettingsMap` is `Record<CompositionId, StyleSettings>` — required or tsc fails).
7. **`components/caption-style-preview.tsx`** — add a `STYLE_PREVIEW_META[<id>]`
   entry and, if the look needs it, a new `Mechanic` + render branch (drives the
   picker thumbnails on the editor + landing).
8. **`app/page.tsx`** — add a `STYLE_LABELS[<id>]` entry (landing style chips).
9. **Verify:** `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build`, then render a still through
   the real pipeline — copy `scripts/verify-position.mts` (uses `getBundle` →
   `selectComposition({ id: 'CaptionRoot', inputProps })` → `renderStill`). Renders
   locally on macOS via the native `@remotion/compositor-darwin-arm64`.

**Obsolete note — do not follow:** the worker bundles these compositions, so shipping a style needs
`npm run build` **and** `pm2 restart all` on the VM (restart clears the cached
Remotion bundle) — not just a Next rebuild. No new deps unless the style pulls a
new font.

**Current deployment:** a style change usually touches both the web picker and
the Remotion bundle. Deploy the web app to Vercel, then redeploy the Remotion
site so Lambda receives the new compositions:

```powershell
npx remotion lambda sites create remotion/Root.tsx --site-name=caption-ai
```

Also rebuild and restart the EC2 worker when a change touches `worker/` or its
dependencies. See `docs/deployment.md` for the complete release sequence.
